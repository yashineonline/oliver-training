## Course Expiry Notices

**Process:**
1. Assign ticket to yourself.
2. Categorize as Customer Support.
3. Verify if the student can extend the course (valid 1 month before expiry).
   - Go to Admin Tools/Reports, Enrollment, Extend Course
   - Search for the student details (by email or username).
   - If the email cannot be found in the system or the username is not evident, email them to request for it (see template below).
   - Check the relevant Purchase Date.
4. If extension possible, email them providing instructions including:
   - Login URL: check for relevant website from the list provided.
   - Username: tell them to use the password they created.
   - Steps to extend
   - Price (e.g., $79): they can complete the transaction online.
5. Close ticket (if simple) or mark as “Pending/Waiting” if escalated (to management or IT).

**Notes:**
- If course expired → student must repurchase.

  - Ref No.: (from Transaction Details)

e.g.
[tag FK] member id: 000000 user: 11AAAA order no. 000000000 process ref. 00000000 (WHY: not activated-purchased on incorrect account)

[tag FK] member id: 000000 user: 11AAAA order no. 000000000 please process a refund for ref. 00000000 (they purchased the wrong course by mistake) [CC SZ]

3. Send to Slack: tag Director and relevant SE Specialist.
Once it has been processed, inform student (French/English) about processing time (3–5 days).

**Advanced steps** (not to be done by new SER)
- Wait for approval/IT confirmation.
- Delete course number from WFG Store and student account if applicable.
- Send another request?
- Once completed by IT (1-2 days), the team will inform "you". 

**Notes**

  - Go to chapter quiz.
  - See if it is activated.
  - Then they are not eligible for refund.
  - Include a screenshot in the email of the refund policy (type it for accessibility purpose).
 
- Some courses come in package:
  - If ethics has been accessed, this is non-refundable.
  - If ethics is blank, then they are eligible for refund.
